## Math on the web

### Rough Notes

[MathML][] is neat, but incredibly verbose to write by hand, and not supported in all browsers at this time. From my experience so far, [AsciiMath][] via [MathJax][] is the sane solution to this.

### Artifacts

_[Visualizing Softmax][]_ is an unfinished exploration of the [softmax function][] which uses [AsciiMath][] for math rendering. The goal is to supply an interactive exploration of the function, with an emphasis on visualization.
